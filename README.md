## 🎯 What is the Rot Scale?

Rot Scale is a playful score system from **0 to 1000**:

| Score Range | Category |
|-------------|----------|
| 0–200       | Anti Rotism |
| 201–500     | Neutral |
| 501–599     | Semi-Rot |
| 600–799     | Officially Brainrotted |
| 800–1000    | Severely Brainrotted |

Higher score = deeper brainrot zone.
